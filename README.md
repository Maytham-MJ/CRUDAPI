<h3>Restful CRUD API</h3>
The Employee Reimbursement System uses an ASP.NET Core Web API written with C# to allow employees and managers to track reimbursement requests related to work expenses. An Azure SQL Database, accessed in the API via ADO.NET, is used to store users and persist reimbursement requests. Users interact with the API by sending HTTP requests and queries via Swagger or Postman. Employees and managers can create, submit, and view tickets containing information related to the request. Managers can then evaluate the request and either approve or deny it.
